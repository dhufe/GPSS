# GPSS

The presented code implements the generalized point source synthesis for acoustic sources. The numerical part is implemented and parallelized using the Cython and runs either 2D or 3D. 

The code is mainly used to calculated sound field of arbitrary acoustic sources.

At this moment the following sources types are supported:

- Circular shaped planar transducers,
- Rectangular shaped planar transducers,
- Spherically curved circular shaped transcuders, 
- Spherically curved rectangular shaped transcuders
